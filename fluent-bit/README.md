# Fluent Bit Docker Image

This image is based on the official [Fluent Bit Docker image](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docker-image).

Changes are made to be based on on the latest debian:testing-slim in contrast to distroless, that is always debian:stable based.

It contains Fluent Bit and the plugin for Loki.
